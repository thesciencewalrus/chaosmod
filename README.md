# Minecraft Chaos Mod - Open World 

A completely vanilla mod that adds chaotic effects to your game every 25 seconds! Works in Minecraft 1.19.3 only.

This "mod" isn't a true mod, but consists of a command block schematic, so it works on literally any Java MC platform (Vanilla, Forge, Fabric, Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, etc.).

Based on [pongo's GTAV chaos mod](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/chaos-mod-v-beta).

## Installation Instructions

#### Default World

Simply [download the world file from here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/minecraft-chaos-mod-vanilla-command-block-creation/), extract the world file into your .minecraft/saves folder, and play! The mod works on both singleplayer and multiplayer servers, so you can use this world for a server as well!

#### Add to Pre-existing World

In order to add this to a pre-existing world, you must download the WorldEdit mod or plugin and import the schematic. Then, go into the bedrock box at the top of the schematic to start the mod.

Instructions on how to import schematics using WorldEdit [can be found in their documentation](https://worldedit.enginehub.org/en/latest/). Please note that in order for the mod to function properly, **you MUST use //paste -e** when importing the schematic.

Please use [their discord](https://discord.gg/enginehub) for any support you may need importing schematics.

## Advantages Over Other Chaos Mods

Of course, there are no shortage of true [Minecraft chaos mods](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entropy). Mine is a personal project and I'm not trying to directly compete. If you're comfortable running Fabric, Im_JC52's mod will likely work best.

However, if you're looking to add the mod to another platform (such as vanilla, Forge, or a Bukkit-based server), or simply don't want to make everyone download the Fabric mod, my chaos mod is able to do so since it isn't a true mod, and therefore hooks directly into vanilla Minecraft mechanics.
